# Notice of removal from GitHub
Due to GitHub's use of hosted repositories to train their Copilot AI system,
which provides code output with no source attribution, in violation of licenses,
this repository has been permanently removed from GitHub.

The primary source for my projects is
[https://tcp80.org/hub.html](https://tcp80.org/hub.html) (primary source), and
some may be found on [Shithub](https://shithub.us/) and
[Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~grobe0ba).
